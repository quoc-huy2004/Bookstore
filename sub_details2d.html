                <li>Legendary storyteller Stephen King goes into the deepest well of his imagination in this
                    spellbinding novel about a seventeen-year-old boy who inherits the keys to a parallel world where
                    good and evil are at war, and the stakes could not be higher‚Äîfor that world or ours. </li>

                Charlie Reade looks like a regular high school kid, great at baseball and football, a decent student.
                But he carries a heavy load. His mom was killed in a hit-and-run accident when he was ten, and grief
                drove his dad to drink. Charlie learned how to take care of himself‚Äîand his dad. When Charlie is
                seventeen, he meets a dog named Radar and her aging master, Howard Bowditch, a recluse in a big house at
                the top of a big hill, with a locked shed in the backyard. Sometimes strange sounds emerge from it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Charlie starts doing jobs for Mr. Bowditch and loses his heart to Radar. Then, when Bowditch dies, he
                leaves Charlie a cassette tape telling a story no one would believe. What Bowditch knows, and has kept
                secret all his long life, is that inside the shed is a portal to another world.

                Magnificent, terrifying, and ‚Äúspellbinding‚Ä¶packed with glorious flights of imagination and
                characteristic tenderness about childhood, Fairy Tale is vintage King at his finest‚Äù (Esquire).
