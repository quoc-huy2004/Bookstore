            <h3> Description </h3>
            <p>
                Even through the roar and effervescence of the 1920s, everyone in New York has heard of Benjamin and
                Helen Rask. He is a legendary Wall Street tycoon; she is the daughter of eccentric aristocrats.
                Together, they have risen to the very top of a world of seemingly endless wealthâ€”all as a decade of
                excess and speculation draws to an end. But at what cost have they acquired their immense fortune? This
                is the mystery at the center of Bonds, a successful 1937 novel that all of New York seems to have read.
                Yet there are other versions of this tale of privilege and deceit.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hernan Diazâ€™s TRUST elegantly puts these competing narratives into conversation with one anotherâ€”and in
                tension with the perspective of one woman bent on disentangling fact from fiction. The result is a novel
                that spans over a century and becomes more exhilarating with each new revelation.


            </p>

            <p>
                At once an immersive story and a brilliant literary puzzle, TRUST engages the reader in a quest for the
                truth while confronting the deceptions that often live at the heart of personal relationships, the
                reality-warping force of capital, and the ease with which power can manipulate facts.
