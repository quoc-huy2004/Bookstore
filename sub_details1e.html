            <h2> Trees: Between Earth and Heaven Hardcover </h2>
            <h3> Description </h3>
            <p>
                Art Wolfeâ€™s immersive photos capture the wonder humans have felt about trees for millennia.
            </p>

            <p>
                From the biblical Tree of Life to the Native American Tree of Peace, trees have played an archetypal
                role in human culture and spirituality since time immemorial. An integral part of a variety of
                faithsâ€”from Buddhism and Hinduism to Native American and aboriginal religionsâ€”trees were venerated long
                before any written historical records existed.
            </p>

            <p>
                Through the vivid images of legendary photographer Art Wolfe, Trees focuses on both individual specimens
                and entire forests, and offers a sweeping yet intimate look at an arboreal world that spans six
                continents. Author Gregory McNamee weaves a diverse and global account of the myths, cultures, and
                traditions that convey the long-standing symbiosis between trees and humans, and renowned ethnobotanist
                Wade Davis anchors the text with a penetrating introduction. Humans have always shared this planet with
                trees, and Trees by Art Wolfe is a breathtaking journey through and homage to that relationship and its
                past, present, and future.
