                "Fourth Wing will have your heart pounding from beginning to end... A fantasy like you've never read
                before." ‚Äï#1 New York Times bestselling author Jennifer L. Armentrout
            </p>

                Enter the brutal and elite world of a war college for dragon riders from New York Times bestselling
                author Rebecca Yarros
            </p>

            <p>
                Twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail was supposed to enter the Scribe Quadrant, living a quiet life among
                books and history. Now, the commanding general‚Äîalso known as her tough-as-talons mother‚Äîhas ordered
                Violet to join the hundreds of candidates striving to become the elite of Navarre: dragon riders.
            </p>

            <p>
                But when you‚Äôre smaller than everyone else and your body is brittle, death is only a heartbeat
                away...because dragons don‚Äôt bond to ‚Äúfragile‚Äù humans. They incinerate them.
            </p>

            <p>
                With fewer dragons willing to bond than cadets, most would kill Violet to better their own chances of
                success. The rest would kill her just for being her mother‚Äôs daughter‚Äîlike Xaden Riorson, the most
                powerful and ruthless wingleader in the Riders Quadrant.
            </p>

            <p>
                She‚Äôll need every edge her wits can give her just to see the next sunrise.
            </p>

            <p>
                Yet, with every day that passes, the war outside grows more deadly, the kingdom's protective wards are
                failing, and the death toll continues to rise. Even worse, Violet begins to suspect leadership is hiding
                a terrible secret.
            </p>

            <P>
                Friends, enemies, lovers. Everyone at Basgiath War College has an agenda‚Äîbecause once you enter, there
                are only two ways out: graduate or die.
