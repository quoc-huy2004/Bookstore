            <h2> Pop Art </h2>
            <h3> Description </h3>
            <p>
                Peaking in the 1960s, Pop Art began as a revolt against mainstream approaches to art and culture and
                evolved into a wholesale interrogation of modern society, consumer culture, the role of the artist, and
                of what constituted an artwork.
            </p>

            <p>
                Focusing on issues of materialism, celebrity, and media, Pop Art drew on mass-market sources, from
                advertising imagery to comic books, from Hollywood's most famous faces to the packaging of consumer
                products, the latter epitomized by Andy Warhol's Campbell's soup cans. As well as challenging the
                establishment with the elevation of such popular, banal, and kitschy images, Pop Art also deployed
                methods of mass-production, reducing the role of the individual artist with mechanized techniques such
                as screen printing.
            </p>

            <p>
                With featured artists including Andy Warhol, Allen Jones, Ed Ruscha, Robert Indiana, Jasper Johns,
                Robert Rauschenberg, and Roy Lichtenstein, this book introduces the full reach and influence of a
                defining modernist movement.

                About the series
            </p>

            <p>
                Born back in 1985, the Basic Art Series has evolved into the best-selling art book collection ever
                published. Each book in TASCHENâ€™s Basic Art History series features:
            <ul>
                <li>approximately 100 color illustrations with explanatory captions</li>
                <li>a detailed, illustrated introduction</li>
                <li>a selection of the most important works of the epoch, each presented on a two-page spread with a
                    full-page image and accompanying interpretation, as well as a portrait and brief biography of the
                    artist</li>
            </ul>
