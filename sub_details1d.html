            <h2> Photography at MoMA: 1960 to Now </h2>
            <h3> Description </h3>
            <p>
                Transformative decades of contemporary photography from the collection of MoMA.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Museum of Modern Art has one of the greatest collections of 20th-century photography in the world.
                As one of three volumes dedicated to a new history of photography published by the Museum, this
                publication comprises a comprehensive catalogue of the collection post-1960s and brings much-needed new
                critical perspective to the most prominent artists working with the photographic medium of the late 20th
                and early 21st centuries. At a moment when photography is undergoing fast-paced changes and artists are
                seeking to redefine its boundaries in new and exciting ways, Photography at MoMA serves as an excellent
                resource for understanding the expanded field of contemporary photography today.
            </p>

            <p>
                The book begins with an in-depth introduction followed by eight chapters of full-color plates, each
                introduced by a short essay. Over 250 artists are featured, including Diane Arbus, John Baldessari, Jan
                Dibbets, Rineke Dijkstra, William Eggleston, Lee Friedlander, Louise Lawler, Zoe Leonard, Helen Levitt,
                Sigmar Polke, Cindy Sherman, Wolfgang Tillmans, Jeff Wall, Carrie Mae Weems, Hannah Wilke and Garry
                Winogrand, among many others.
