            <h2> The Way I Used to Be </h2>
            <h3> Description </h3>
            <p>
                New York Times bestseller! In the tradition of Speak, Amber Smith's extraordinary debut novel ‚Äúis a
                heart-twisting, but ultimately hopeful, exploration of how pain can lead to strength‚Äù (The Boston
                Globe).
            </p>

            <p>
                Eden was always good at being good. Starting high school didn‚Äôt change who she was. But the night her
                brother‚Äôs best friend rapes her, Eden‚Äôs world capsizes.
            </p>

            <p>
                What was once simple, is now complex. What Eden once loved‚Äîwho she once loved‚Äîshe now hates. What she
                thought she knew to be true, is now lies. Nothing makes sense anymore, and she knows she‚Äôs supposed to
                tell someone what happened but she can‚Äôt. So she buries it instead. And she buries the way she used to
                be.
            </p>

            <p>
                Told in four parts‚Äîfreshman, sophomore, junior, and senior year‚Äîthis provocative debut reveals the deep
                cuts of trauma. But it also demonstrates one young woman‚Äôs strength as she navigates the disappointment
                and unbearable pains of adolescence, of first love and first heartbreak, of friendships broken and
                rebuilt, all while learning to embrace the power of survival she never knew she had hidden within her
                heart.
